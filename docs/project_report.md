## Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 is the virus responsible of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which became a worlwide pandemic a few years ago. This virus is tought to be spread by droplets produced when a person coughs or sneezes, and also by touching infected surfaces and then touching mouth, eyes or nose. In this context, they were also found elements from this coronavirus in wastewater in many different countries. Concentrations of these elements were measured and registered in open-access databases, with samples from different places and from different dates. 


## Problem Statement

In this project, we intend to visualize the dynamics of COVID-19 infection in Scotland using two approaches:
1. By location, examining the patterns in infection development that characterize each location and are shared between different locations;
2. Across time, analyzing how the infection spread overall and identifying its peak periods.

## Methods

The data used for this project comes from the Global Water Pathogens Project 2024, available at https://sphere.waterpathogens.org/search.

The datasets we will use were collected by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. These data are stored in two CSV files, structured as follows:

1. The first dataset, named "SEPA - Sites CSV," contains information about the sampled sites. The columns of interest are:
- site_id
- latitude
- longitude

2. The second dataset, "SEPA - Samples CSV," has concentration values and associated dates of collection. The relevant columns are:
- Site ID
- Date/Time
- Target 1 Concentration
- Sample ID

Both datasets are in CSV format. The data files are available in `data` directory in this repository.

#### Research questions  
##### A. How are the samples distributed?   
1. Generate clusters of the samples in dataset acording to the location ID.    
2. Generate a map of the samples, to see where the most of them were located.  
  
##### B. By clustering the samples by location, which cluster contains the highest concentrations? 
1. With the clusters created for the previous question, create a boxplot to show which of the clusters has the highest concentration values.  
  
##### C. How did concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater change througout time?  
1. Generate a plot of the concentration variation throught diferrent months, in order to find out which months reported the highest concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 residues in wastewater.  



## Results

##### A. How are the samples distributed?  
We generated the following map creating clusters acording with the locations IDs of each sample. In doing so, we realized that most of SARS-CoV-2 samples in wastewater were located in Dumfries and Galloway, and also in Scottish Borders. Additionaly, we expected to see a pettern in the way the clusters generated, nevertheless, al least by location, it didn't seems to by one, we suppose that maybe other factors like poblational demsity or even the trasheater system coild be correlated with the clustering.

##### B. By clustering the samples by location, which cluster contains the highest concentrations?  
We also analized the clusters generated by location, looking for that one with the highest concentrations. In both plots, by median and by mean conventration, it is important to notice that cluster 1 just contains one sample, so it is not that relevant in this comparison.  
By analyzing the mean values, we found that cluster 3 got the highest concentrations.

We observed the same result by comparing datasets by median concentration values.

##### C. How did concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater change througout time?  
By analizing mean concentration variation throughout time, we found that the highest peaks ocurred about August 2021 and in March 2022, decreasing until the final months of 2022. During 2023, we do not see peaks as high as in the previous year, but we still found an increase around Agoust 2023.

## Discussion and Conclusion
In this analysis, we found that most of the samples in the dataset came from Scottish Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, so the results that we present are representative of those places.  
When we clustered the samples by location, we observed that the third one got the highest concentrations. Most of the samples in this cluster (red dots in map) are located near the borders with England, so maybe the movement of people from one country to another could be an important factor to make this cluster have a higher concentration of SARS-CoV-2 elements in wastewater.  
Finally, we saw one of the highest peaks in SARS-CoV-2 elements concentration in wastewater after January 2022, which is a few months after Omicron variant was reported and when many of the restrictions to avoid COVID-19 propagation were relaxed or removed. We also found a peak in mean concentrations around August 2023, but we do not see this in median concentrations, which may indicate that there were just a few samples that presented extremely high concentrartions, which could indicate the places were restrictions were more relaxed or where medical material used to treat COVID-19 was mostly threw to water.    
In conclusion, COVID-19 pandemic was an historic event that has a remarkable effect in human lifestyle and in our environment, and even a few years after the beggining of this crisis, we are still recovering from it.
